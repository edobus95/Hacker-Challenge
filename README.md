# Hacker-Challenge
Hacker Challenge Imperial 2020

This is my attempt to the Hacker Challenge 2020 at Imperial for the course "Data Structures and Algorithms"
The task is to write a Python program that automatically downloads course materials from the Hub to your computer.

I have attempted this challenge using Python. I used the Selenium library with a Chrome webdriver.

You will find 5 files in this repository:

1) Hacker Challenge.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook containing the code and the explaination of my approach to the challenge.
2) Hacker_Challenge.py: This is the same code as above but in a python script.
3) requirements.txt: This is the file that contains the names of the libraries that are needed for this script to work. The script will automatically install these libraries when you run it.
4) win_chromedriver.exe: This is the Chrome webdriver for Windows. I use Chrome 86, if you have a different version of chrome you have to download the corresponding webdriver into this folder and rename it like this file. You can find the webdrivere here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
5) chromedriver: This is the Chrome webdriver for Mac. If it does not work for you download the corresponding webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
